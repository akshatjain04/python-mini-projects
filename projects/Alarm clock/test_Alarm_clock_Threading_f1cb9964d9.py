"""
1. Verify that the "Threading" function is callable and executes without errors.
2. Verify that "Threading" function creates a new instance of Thread.
3. Verify that the Thread created is assigned the target method "alarm".
4. Test if the "Threading" function actually starts the thread by calling the `t1.start()` method.
5. Exception handling: Ensure that the "Threading" function handles any exceptions that could occur during the creation or execution of the new thread.
6. Test if the target method "alarm" is actually defined and callable.
7. Test the behavior of the function if "alarm" takes unusually long to execute. Observing whether the code continues executing or waits for the "alarm" function to finish will help.
8. Test if "alarm" function interrupts its process on its own or if it should be stopped by "Threading" function.
9. Test how the "Threading" function behaves when it's called multiple times in a row.
