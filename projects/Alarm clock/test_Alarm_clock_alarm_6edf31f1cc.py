"""
1. Scenario: Function is initialized with an hour, minute, and second set to a valid future time.
    Expected Result: The alarm should go off exactly at the set time.

2. Scenario: Function is initialized with an hour, minute, and second set in the past relative to the current time.
    Expected Result: The alarm should not ring as it is set to a time in the past.
   
3. Scenario: Function is initialized with invalid time inputs, such as an hour greater than 23, minute or second greater than 59.
    Expected Result: The function should fail/signal an error, as input values are not in the expected range.
   
4. Scenario: Function is initialized with time inputs of correct value but wrong type, such as strings instead of integers.
    Expected Result: The function should fail/signal an error, as input values are not of expected type.
   
5. Scenario: Multiple instances of the function are initialized with different alarm times.
    Expected Result: Each instance of the function should work independently and cause their alarms to ring at the correct specified times.
   
6. Scenario: Function is initialized with an hour, minute, and second set to current time.
    Expected Result: The alarm should go off immediately or within 1 second of the function call, since the current time is equal to the alarm time.
   
7. Scenario: The function is called but the "sound.wav" file is missing or not accessible.
    Expected Result: The function should handle the missing file error gracefully, ideally it should signal about the missing file and not crash. 

8. Scenario: The alarm time has hit and is ringing, test the functionality at this point.
    Expected Result: It should continue to print "Time to Wake up" and play sound every second until stopped and not crash or stop abruptly.

9. Scenario: Check how the function responses to system sleep or hibernation, when the system goes to sleep mode after setting the alarm time and wakes up after the alarm time.
    Expected Result: The behavior may vary depending on the system, but ideally, the function should handle this scenario gracefully. It either does not go off or rings immediately as the system wakes up.

10. Scenario: Function is running and set alarm time is updated.
    Expected Result: The function should read the latest time and ring the alarm accordingly.

11. Scenario: Testing the robustness of the function. Let it run for a very long time and check for any memory leaks or crashes.
    Expected Result: The function should not crash and should run for an extended period without any memory leaks or using unreasonable amounts of resources.
