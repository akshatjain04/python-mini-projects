"""
1. Positive Test Case: Test by passing image with normal shape and ensure it returns an appropriately resized and threshold applied image as output.

2. Negative Test Case: Test by passing in a non-image object, the function should handle such situations, potentially by raising an error.

3. Edge Test Case: Test by passing a single color image (black or white), the function should not fail and return a resized and threshold applied image.

4. Edge Test Case: Test by passing an image which is smaller than the specified resize parameters. It should not affect the original size of the image.

5. Positive Test Case: Test by passing an image with extreme sizes and verify if the function can handle it without crashing and return a resized and threshold applied image.

6. Negative Test Case: Test by passing an empty image, the function should handle this and potentially raise an error.

7. Positive Test Case: Test by passing an image with different resolutions, the function should correctly resize and apply threshold to the image.

8. Edge Test Case: Test with an image where all pixel values are the same, it should correctly handle this and resize and apply threshold as per the function definition.

9. Negative Test Case: Test by passing None as an argument, should handle this error and possibly raise an exception.

10. Edge Test Case: Test with a high detailed (High resolution) image, ensure that the program doesn't hang or crash while resizing and applying threshold. 

11. Positive Test Case: Test by passing a grayscale image, the function should work correctly and return a resized and threshold applied image.

12. Performance Test Case: Test by passing a collection of images in loop, observe the time consumed to test the performance of the method.
