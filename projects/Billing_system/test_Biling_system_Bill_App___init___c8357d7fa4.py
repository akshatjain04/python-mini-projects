Test Scenarios for Billing Software:

1. Missing/Incorrect data entry for Product -
Add validation scenarios for all entry fields for the products, especially for quantity. Check whether it is accepting only integer value or gives warning/error for negative or float/character values.

2. Missing Customer details -
Ensure the software provides an error if any of the required customer's fields like name or phone number are left empty.

3. Testing Bill Number -
Ensure the bill number that is being generated is unique for every customer. Check whether the bill number is four digit number or not. Check how the software behaves when the range of 1000-9999 is exhausted.

4. Confirm the Bill entry -
Test whether the Bill button is generating a bill correctly with all the relevant details such as customer's details, product details & total amount.

5. Search an existing bill -
Check if the Search button is functioning as expected, ideally it should fetch the details of a bill when a valid bill number is entered.

6. Test the Total button -
On clicking the Total button the total of all products (quantity * rate of each product) should be calculated correctly and taxes, if any, are calculated and added to the price.

7. Clear button test -
Check if the Clear button is functioning and is able to clear all the fields.

8. Exit button test -
Test if the Exit button is working as expected and the software/application is closing when 'Exit' is clicked.

9. Check UI -
At last, ensure all the labels, button, and text areas of this billing software according to the snippet code are displayed and properly aligned.

10. Test taxes - 
Determine if the taxes are being correctly calculated for each product category. 

Note: While this is not a complete set of test scenarios, it can serve as a starting point for testing this function. Depending on the context, functionality, and requirements of the application, additional test scenarios may need to be created.
