```
Scenario 1: User accepts the exit prompt
Details:
  TestName: test_exit_app_accept
  Description: This test verifies that the application's main window is destroyed when the user confirms the exit prompt positively.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the messagebox.askyesno to return True, simulating user clicking 'Yes' on the exit dialog.
  Act: Call the exit_app method.
  Assert: Check that self.root.destroy is called, confirming that the main window is intended to be closed.
Validation:
  Rationalizing this test is important as it ensures that the exit functionality responds correctly to user input, adhering to expected application behavior when the user wishes to exit.

Scenario 2: User declines the exit prompt
Details:
  TestName: test_exit_app_decline
  Description: This test checks that the application's main window remains intact when the user declines the exit prompt.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the messagebox.askyesno to return False, simulating user clicking 'No' on the exit dialog.
  Act: Call the exit_app method.
  Assert: Ensure that self.root.destroy is not called, implying that the main window remains open.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for verifying that the application respects the user's decision to continue using the app, thereby enhancing user control and interaction confidence.

Scenario 3: Exit prompt behavior on unexpected messagebox return values
Details:
  TestName: test_exit_app_unexpected_return
  Description: This test ensures that the application handles unexpected return values from the messagebox gracefully without crashing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the messagebox.askyesno to return a non-boolean unexpected value (e.g., None or an integer).
  Act: Call the exit_app method.
  Assert: Check that the method completes without errors, and verify that no unintended behavior occurs (like calling self.root.destroy unexpectedly).
Validation:
  Testing this scenario ensures robustness in the application's error handling, safeguarding against crashes or undefined behaviors under unexpected conditions.

Scenario 4: Testing the exit prompt trigger
Details:
  TestName: test_exit_prompt_trigger
  Description: Verify that the messagebox for exit confirmation is triggered when the exit_app method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup the environment with necessary GUI elements initialized.
  Act: Invoke the exit_app method.
  Assert: Confirm that messagebox.askyesno is called with the correct arguments ("Exit", "Do you really want to exit?").
Validation:
  This test confirms that the exit prompt is reliably triggered upon request to exit, which is essential for consistent user experience and application flow control.
