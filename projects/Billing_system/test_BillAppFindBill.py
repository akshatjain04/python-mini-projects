### Scenario 1: Bill File Exists and is Readable
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_existing_bill
  Description: Test if the function correctly identifies and reads a bill file when it exists in the specified directory.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock bill file in the 'bills/' directory with a known bill number and content.
  Act: Set the `search_bill` variable to the known bill number and call `find_bill`.
  Assert: Check that the content of the mock bill file is correctly displayed in `txtarea`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can locate and read files correctly, which is essential for retrieving historical billing data. This is crucial for customer service and auditing purposes.

### Scenario 2: Bill File Does Not Exist
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_non_existing_bill
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when the specified bill file does not exist in the directory.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the 'bills/' directory does not contain a file with the specified bill number.
  Act: Set the `search_bill` variable to a non-existing bill number and call `find_bill`.
  Assert: Check that an error message is displayed indicating "Invalid Bill No".
Validation:
  This test validates the function's error handling capability when a bill number does not correspond to any existing file, which is critical for maintaining data integrity and providing accurate user feedback.

### Scenario 3: Directory Reading Permission Issue
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_permission_error
  Description: Test the function's response when there is a permission issue accessing the 'bills/' directory.
Execution:
  Arrange: Modify the permissions of the 'bills/' directory to simulate a permission error.
  Act: Attempt to execute `find_bill`.
  Assert: Check that the appropriate error handling occurs, potentially catching an exception or displaying an error message.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the robustness of the function in handling scenarios where directory access permissions are restricted, ensuring the application can gracefully handle such exceptions and inform the user.

### Scenario 4: Corrupted or Unreadable Bill File
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_corrupted_file
  Description: Ensure the function handles cases where a bill file exists but is corrupted or unreadable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock bill file with garbled or non-standard content.
  Act: Set the `search_bill` variable to this bill's number and call `find_bill`.
  Assert: Check how the function handles reading a corrupted fileâ€”whether it fails silently, throws an error, or handles the situation gracefully.
Validation:
  Testing the function's ability to deal with corrupted files is essential for ensuring data reliability and robust error handling in real-world scenarios where file corruption might occur.

### Scenario 5: Large Bill File Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_large_file
  Description: Test the function's performance and correctness when handling unusually large bill files.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock bill file in the 'bills/' directory that is significantly larger than typical bills.
  Act: Set the `search_bill` variable to this large bill's number and call `find_bill`.
  Assert: Verify that the function can handle the large file without performance degradation or errors, and that the entire content is properly loaded into `txtarea`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring the application can handle edge cases involving large data files without crashing or slowing down, ensuring scalability and reliability.
