ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=total_11f4f7312f


### Scenario 1: All items have zero quantity
Details:
  TestName: test_total_with_zero_items
  Description: Ensure that the total method calculates the bill correctly when all item quantities are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize all item variables to 0.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Verify that the total prices for medical, grocery, and cold drinks are all zero. Also, the taxes should be zero.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to confirm that the system can handle the edge case without any items purchased and returns a total of zero, which is crucial for accurate billing and financial reporting.

### Scenario 2: Normal non-zero quantities for all categories
Details:
  TestName: test_total_with_normal_values
  Description: Test the total calculation when all categories have typical non-zero values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a typical number of items for each category (e.g., 5 masks, 3 sanitizers).
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Ensure the total prices and taxes are calculated correctly according to the predefined item rates.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of verifying that the method can accurately compute totals and taxes under normal conditions, ensuring reliability in everyday use.

### Scenario 3: Negative quantities provided
Details:
  TestName: test_total_with_negative_values
  Description: Check the behavior of the total method when negative values are inputted for item quantities.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set some item quantities to negative values.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Verify that the method handles negative numbers appropriately, potentially treating them as zero or raising an error.
Validation:
  Rationalize testing negative inputs as they could represent data entry errors. It is crucial to ensure that the system is robust against such inputs, either by correcting or flagging them.

### Scenario 4: Extremely high quantities
Details:
  TestName: test_total_with_high_values
  Description: Test the `total` method's performance and accuracy with unusually high item quantities.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set extremely high values for some items (e.g., 10000 masks).
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Check that the total and taxes are calculated correctly without overflow or performance degradation.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test to ensure that the system can handle large transactions, which might occur during bulk purchases or stock updates.

### Scenario 5: Tax calculation accuracy
Details:
  TestName: test_tax_accuracy
  Description: Ensure that the tax calculations are precise to two decimal places as specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set quantities that result in fractional taxes.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Verify that the taxes for each category are rounded to two decimal places.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test by confirming the financial accuracy of the tax calculations, which is critical for meeting legal and accounting standards.

### Scenario 6: Integration with GUI components
Details:
  TestName: test_gui_integration
  Description: Ensure that the total method updates the GUI components correctly with the calculated values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set some item quantities and associated GUI components.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Check that the GUI components (like total and tax labels) reflect the calculated values correctly.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test to ensure that the GUI is in sync with the backend calculations, providing a consistent and reliable user experience.
