"""
1. Frame Visual Confirmation: Run the function and visually confirm that an appropriately sized and positioned frame has been created with a white background.

2. Label Visual Confirmation: Run the function and visually confirm that a Label has been appropriately created within the frame. It should be properly anchored to the south side of the frame, and confirm the font and its size and style. Also validate that while running the script the label appears with black font color and white background.

3. Check Clock Time: Run the function and visually confirm that the label is displaying the current time in the format '%I:%M:%S %p'. 

4. Check Time Update: Run the function and observe it over multiple seconds. Confirm that the time displayed on the digital clock updates every second.

5. Check Persistence of Frame and Label: Run the function and minimize or otherwise manipulate the application window. Ensure that the frame and label persist and continue to display the correct information when the window is restored. 

6. Check Method Call: Validate the method 'time' is getting called on invoking function 'light_theme'. You might need to modify a function for this validation to print or log at the start of function 'time'.

7. Check Performance: Check the performance of the function when running over an extended period. It should not cause dis-proportionate CPU or memory usage.

8. Check dismiss or close: Check how the application handles if user tries to close the digital clock. There should not be any abrupt application shutdown or error message pop-up. 

Note: Some of these cases would require you to check visually or modify the code slightly (e.g., add print statements or logs), as they involve GUI components which cannot be checked purely with code-based test scenarios.

  # TODO: Run the test and check visually if the frame and label are displaying correctly.
  # TODO: Run the test over an extended period and check the CPU and memory usage.
  # TODO: Interact with the application while running this test and make note of any inconsistencies or issues.
  # TODO: Attempt to close the digital clock while running this test and monitor how the application handles it.
