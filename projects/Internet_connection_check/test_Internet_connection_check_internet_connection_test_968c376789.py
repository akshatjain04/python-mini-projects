# Test generated by RoostGPT for test MiniPythonProjects using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

"""
1. Scenario: Test when there is an active internet connection
   - Using a system/environment that has active internet connection.
   - When the function `internet_connection_test()` is called, it should return True, indicating that the internet connection is active.
   - Verify if the successful connection message is printed as well.

2. Scenario: Test when there is no active internet connection
   - Using a system/environment that has no active internet connection.
   - When the function `internet_connection_test()` is called, it should return False, indicating that the internet connection is not active.
   - Verify if the failed connection message is printed as well.

3. Scenario: Test when there is a slow/responding late internet connection. 
   - Using a system/environment that has slow internet connection which responds after the timeout period.
   - When the function `internet_connection_test()` is called, it should return False, indicating that the request to the URL has taken longer than the timeout period specified (10 seconds in this case).
   - Verify if the failed connection message is printed as well.

4. Scenario: Test when there is a connection error other than internet connectivity
   - Use mocking or artificial setup to trigger a ConnectionError during function call.
   - When the function `internet_connection_test()` is called, it should return False, indicating that there was a connection error.
   - Verify if the appropriate error message is printed as well.

5. Scenario: Test for other exceptions that are not ConnectionErrors.
   - Use mocking or artificial setup to trigger a non-ConnectionError exception during function call.
   - When the function `internet_connection_test()` is called, it should return False, as there was an error other than a ConnectionError.
   - Verify if the "Failed with unparsed reason." message is printed as well.

6. Scenario: Verify that the specified URL is being used to check the internet connection
   - Ensure that the printed logs contain the specific URL ('https://www.google.com/') that is used to check the internet connection.
