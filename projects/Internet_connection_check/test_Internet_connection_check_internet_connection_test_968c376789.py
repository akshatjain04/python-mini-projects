"""
Scenario 1: Internet connection is present
Given that there is a valid internet connection 
When the internet_connection_test function is run
Then it should be able to make a GET request to 'https://www.google.com/'
And it should return True for a successful internet connectivity check

Scenario 2: Internet connection is not present
Given that there is no valid internet connection 
When the internet_connection_test function is run
Then it should not be able to make a GET request to 'https://www.google.com/'
And it should return False for connectivity check due to ConnectionError exception

Scenario 3: GET request times out
Given that there is a valid internet connection but response is not received within the specified timeout 
When the internet_connection_test function is run
Then it should not be able to complete the GET request to 'https://www.google.com/'
And it should return False due to the timeout exception

Scenario 4: Other exceptions while making a GET request
Given that there is a issue while making a request that is not a ConnectionError or timeout
When the internet_connection_test function is run
Then it should return False due to the unparsed error exception

Scenario 5: Internet connection is present but the status code returned is not 200
Given that there is a valid internet connection 
When the internet_connection_test function is run
And the returned status code is not 200
Then the function should handle this scenario appropriately to either return True or False based on the business requirement
