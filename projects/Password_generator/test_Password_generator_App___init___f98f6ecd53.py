"""
1. Scenario: Validate the application window is loaded with title 'password_generator'
    - Check if the application window has the title 'password_generator'.

2. Scenario: Validate if the application window icon is set as 'logo.ico'
    - Check if 'logo.ico' is set as the iconbitmap for the application window.

3. Scenario: Verify if the application window icon photo is set as 'logo.png'
    - Check if 'logo.png' is set as the icon photo for the application window.

4. Scenario: Validate if the application window has the correct geometry
    - Check if the geometry of the window is set to '500x255'.

5. Scenario: Validate if the application window background color is set to gray
    - Check if the window's background color is set to 'gray'.

6. Scenario: Check if 'label()' method is called during the initialization
    - Create a mock for 'label()' method and check if it's being called when the object is initialized.

7. Scenario: Check if 'entry()' method is called during the initialization
    - Create a mock for 'entry()' method and check if it's being called when the object is initialized.

8. Scenario: Check if 'button()' method is called during the initialization
    - Create a mock for 'button()' method and check if it's being called when the object is initialized.

9. Scenario: Check if the application window is an instance of 'Tk'
    - Check if 'self.window' is an instance of 'Tk'.

10. Scenario: Validate the user interface consistency on multiple launches
    - Launch the application multiple times and validate that the user interface is consistent across launches.
