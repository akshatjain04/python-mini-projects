"""
1. Scenario: Validate if the window instance is created with the 'Tk()' class
    - Check if 'self.window' is an instance of the 'Tk()' class

2. Scenario: Validate that the window is appropriately titled
    - Check if the window title is "password_generator"

3. Scenario: Validate if the window has the expected icon
    - Check if 'self.window.iconbitmap' is set to 'logo.ico'
    - Check if 'self.window.iconphoto' False is followed by a PhotoImage file named 'logo.png'.

4. Scenario: Validate if the window size has been set correctly
    - Check if 'self.window.geometry' is set to '500x255'

5. Scenario: Validate the window background color
    - Check if 'self.window.config' has bg set to 'gray'

6. Scenario: Validate if the label() method is called once in the '__init__' method
    - Mock the 'self.label()' method and check if it is called exactly once when running the '__init__' method

7. Scenario: Validate if the entry() method is called once in the '__init__' method
    - Mock the 'self.entry()' method and check if it is called exactly once when running the '__init__' method

8. Scenario: Validate if the button() method is called once in the '__init__' method
    - Mock the 'self.button()' method and check if it is called exactly once when running the '__init__' method.
    
9. Scenario: Validate that no exceptions are thrown during initialization
    - Run '__init__' and validate no exceptions are thrown.
    
10. Scenario: Validate that the window is not displayed during initialization
    - Run '__init__' and check that the window is not visible.
