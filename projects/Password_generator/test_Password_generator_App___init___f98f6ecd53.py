"""
1. Scenario: Window Initialization Check
    - Description: Validate that the initial Tk() window is correctly set up. 

2. Scenario: Window Title Check
    - Description: Validate that the window title is set as 'password_generator'.

3. Scenario: Window Icon Check
    - Description: Validate that the logo icon (logo.ico) is correctly set for the application window.

4. Scenario: Window Icon Image Check
    - Description: Validate that the icon photo (logo.png) is correctly set for the application window.

5. Scenario: Window Geometry Check
    - Description: Validate that the window dimensions are correctly set to be 500x255.

6. Scenario: Window Background Color Check
    - Description: Validate that the background color of the window is correctly set to 'gray'.

7. Scenario: Component Creation: Label Check
    - Description: Validate that the 'label()' component is correctly created for the window.

8. Scenario: Component Creation: Entry Check
    - Description: Validate that the 'entry()' component is correctly created for the window.

9. Scenario: Component Creation: Button Check
    - Description: Validate that the 'button()' component is correctly created for the window.

10. Scenario: Component Functionality Check
    - Description: Validate that all the created components (label, entry, button) are working as expected individually (e.g., label shows the right content, entry takes and displays input correctly, button is clickable etc.) 

11. Scenario: Overall Functionality Check
    - Description: Validate that all components work well together and the overall application functionality is as expected.
   
12. Scenario: Resource Availability Check
    - Description: Confirm that logo.ico and logo.png are available and in the correct format.
   
13. Scenario: UI test
    - Description: Validate that all the components are properly placed and UI looks as per the initial design.
   
14. Scenario: Resizability Check
    - Description: Validate if the window is resizable or not. As per requirements, if the window is not supposed to be resizable, ensure that user cannot resize the window. If it is supposed to be resizable, check if the components within the window adjust themselves correctly while resizing window.

# Test for Component Functionality
# Due to tkinter being an event driven library, it's hard to test the tkinter event loop interactions such as clicking a button or providing user input without using the real tk event loop. 
# The test below only cover the initial state of your application and does not guarantee it will interactively function as expected.

# Test for Resource Availability
@pytest.mark.parametrize("filename", ['logo.ico', 'logo.png'])
def test_resources_availability(filename):
    assert os.path.exists(filename)

# The detailed UI test and Resizability Check would involve integration tests and can't be tested using pytest unit tests
