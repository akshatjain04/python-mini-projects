"""
1. Scenario: Testing if the button is successfully created
   Test Steps: Call the button function and observe the user interface
   Expected result: A button with label "Generate_password" should be displayed on the UI

   Expected result: The button label should be "Generate_password", the font style must be 'Courrier' with size 12, the background color should be white, the font color should be black and width should be 25

3. Scenario: Testing button click functionality
   Test Steps: Click the button after the UI is rendered
   Expected result: password_generator_App_button clicked event must be triggered and the generate_password method must be called

4. Scenario: Checking if a single click on the button triggers the generate_password  method only once.
   Test Steps: Click on the button and count how many times the generate_password method is triggered.
   Expected result: The generate_password method should be triggered only once per button click

5. Scenario: Testing multiple clicks
   Test Steps: Click the button multiple times consecutively
   Expected result: The generate_password method should be triggered once for every single click

6. Scenario: Testing button width adjustment
   Test Steps:      Adjust the GUI window size and observe the button width
   Expected result: The button width should not exceed the set width, which is 25

7. Scenario: Testing button accessibility
   Test Steps: Try to click the button immediately after the window is loaded
   Expected result: The button should be accessible and callable immediately after the window loads

8. Scenario: Check the object type of the button.
   Test Steps: Check the object type after the button is created.
   Expected result: The type of the created object should be "Button"
   
9. Scenario: Check if the button is present in the current window.
   Test Steps: Check the window contents after the button creation.

# Remaining test scenarios would require interaction with a GUI which cannot be done using just pytest. Tools like Selenium or similar may be required for such test cases.
