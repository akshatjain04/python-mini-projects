"""
Scenario 1: Successful password generation
- Description: This scenario entails successfully generating a password when the "Generate_password" button is clicked. It should validate that the password is successfully generated.
- Steps: 
    1. Open the application. 
    2. Click on the "Generate_password" button.

Scenario 2: Button display
- Description: This scenario validates that the "Generate_password" button is displayed correctly. It should match the defined properties such as text, font, background, color, width and command attached to the button.
- Steps:
    1. Open the application.
    2. Verify the display properties of the "Generate_password" button.

Scenario 3: Repeat password generation
- Description: This scenario checks if the app can generate new passwords on multiple clicks of the button. It is important to ensure that a unique password is generated each time the button is pressed.
- Steps:
    1. Open the application.
    2. Click on the "Generate_password" button.
    3. Note the generated password.
    4. Click on the "Generate_password" button again.

Scenario 4: No duplication in generated passwords
- Description: This scenario verifies that each generated password is unique and there is no duplication in generated passwords. 
- Steps:
    1. Open the application.
    2. Generate a specified number of passwords by clicking the "Generate_password" button.
    3. Check the generated passwords for any duplication.

Scenario 5: Availability of generated password
- Description: This scenario validates whether the generated password is accessible or visible to the user once the "Generate_password" button is clicked.
- Steps:
    1. Open the application.
    2. Click on the "Generate_password" button.
    3. Verify that the password is visible or accessible to the user.

Scenario 6: Non-functioning button
- Description: This scenario tests the condition when the "Generate_password" button doesn't function as intended due to faulty implementation or other errors. It should help in identifying such problems.
- Steps:
    1. Open the application.
    2. Click on the "Generate_password" button.
    3. Verify that the password generation process is performed correctly. 

Scenario 7: Button properties modification at runtime
- Description: This scenario validates whether changes to the button properties at runtime (like changing the button text, color, command etc.) are reflected as expected.
- Steps:
    1. Open the application.
    2. Modify some properties of the "Generate_password" button at runtime.
    3. Check if the modifications are reflected in the button as expected.
