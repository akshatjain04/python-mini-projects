"""
1. Scenario: Validate correct generation of password entry component.
   Given the application is running,
   When `entry()` function is called,
   Then it should create the password entry with correct details (Font should be 'Courier, 25', Background Color should be white, Foreground Color should be black, width should be 30, relief should be 'solid') and should be packed with padding y equal to 50.

2. Scenario: Check the initial state of the password entry component.
   Given the application is running,
   When `entry()` function is called,
   Then the password entry should be blank initially.

3. Scenario: Check if the password entry component is editable.
   Given the application is running,
   When `entry()` function is called,
   And user clicks on the password entry,
   Then the user should be able to enter inputs in the password entry field.

4. Scenario: Check the padding of the password entry component.
   Given the application is running,
   When `entry()` function is called,
   Then the password entry field should have a vertical padding equivalent to 50.

5. Scenario: Check if the password entry gets cleared when called again
   Given the application is running,
   And user has already entered data in the password entry field,
   When `entry()` function is called again,
   Then the password entry field should be cleared/reset.

6. Scenario: Check if the entry field is visible.
   Given the application is running,
   When `entry()` function is called,
   Then the password entry field should be visible to the user.

7. Scenario: Validate the attributes of password entry component.
   Given the application is running,
   When `entry()` function is called,
   Then the password entry should have the correct attributes (Font as 'Courrier, 25', background color as 'white', foreground color as 'black', width as 30, relief as 'solid').
