"""
1. Scenario: Validating Password Length

    Description: The function should generate passwords that have a length of 28 characters. This important aspect needs to be validated.

2. Scenario: Password Contains Uppercase Letter

    Description: The function should generate passwords which contains at least one uppercase letter. This is necessary to ensure the generated password meets basic complexity requirement.

3. Scenario: Password Contains Lowercase Letter
  
    Description: The function should generate passwords which contains at least one lowercase letter. This is necessary to ensure the generated password meets basic complexity requirement.

4. Scenario: Password Contains Digit
  
    Description: The function should generate passwords which contains at least one digit. This is necessary to ensure the generated password meets basic complexity requirement.

5. Scenario: Password Contains Special Character

    Description: The function should generate passwords which contains at least one special character. This is necessary to ensure the generated password meets basic complexity requirement.

6. Scenario: Generation of Multiple Passwords
   
    Description: Generating multiple passwords consecutively should result in different outputs each time. It needs to be validated if the function is generating truly random passwords.

7. Scenario: Validate Password Entry Deletion 

    Description: The function should erase any existing data in the password entry field before inserting a new password. This needs to be validated to ensure the function is correctly resetting the field.

8. Scenario: Validate Password Entry Insertion

    Description: The password generated should be correctly inserted into the password entry field. It needs to be validated that the function is correctly inserting the data.
   
9. Scenario: Validate function if password_entry is None (Initial state of password_entry)

    Description:  The function should handle the scenario when password_entry is None, meaning it's in it's initial state. This needs to be validated to ensure the function performs correctly from initial state.
