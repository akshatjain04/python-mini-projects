"""
1. Scenario: Check if password is generated with the correct length  
   - The generate_password function should return a password of length 28.

2. Scenario: Validate that the password contains at least one uppercase letter  
   - The generated password should contain at least one uppercase letter from ascii_letters.

3. Scenario: Validate that the password has at least one lowercase letter  
   - The password generated should contain at least one lowercase letter from ascii_letters.

4. Scenario: Check if a password contains at least one digit  
   - The password generated should contain at least one character from string.digits.

5. Scenario: Check if a password contains at least one special character  
   - The password generated should include at least one special character from string.punctuation.

6. Scenario: Validate that password changes every time it's generated  
   - A new password generated should not be equal to the previous one.  

7. Scenario: The password_entry should be cleared before a new password is inserted  
   - The password_entry textbox should be empty before a new password is inserted in it.

8. Scenario: The newly generated password appears in the password_entry at the correct location  
   - The password should be inserted at the start (0, position) of the password_entry field.

9. Scenario: Check if generate_password is generating a completely random password  
   - Multiple invocations of generate_password should generate different passwords, considering the large character set and password length. 

10. Scenario: Check if password contains any character outside the defined character set  
    - The password should not contain any characters outside ascii_letters, punctuation and digits.
