# Test generated by RoostGPT for test MiniPythonProjects using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

"""
1. Scenario: Check if the generated passwords are unique.
   Description: Each time the password_generator_App_generate_password function is called, it should produce a unique password. This ensures password identifiers are always unique and unguessable.

2. Scenario: Check if the password length is correct.
   Description: Check if the length of the password is 28. Each generated password should be 28 characters long, as per the business logic.

3. Scenario: Check if the password includes all required characters.
   Description: The password must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character. 

4. Scenario: Check if the password does not contain any whitespace.
   Description: Validate that the generated password does not contain any whitespace characters. 

5. Scenario: Check if the password entry field was cleared before new password generation.
   Description: Before generating and inserting a new password, check if the previous password in the password entry field (if any) was deleted.

6. Scenario: Check if the newly generated password is inserted into the password entry field.
   Description: After password generation, check if the password_entry field contains the newly generated password.

7. Scenario: Check if the generated password does not contain any forbidden characters.
   Description: While the password should contain characters from string.ascii_letters + string.punctuation + string.digits, there should not be any other characters in the password.

8. Scenario: Check if the password does not start or end with a special character. 
   Description: Although the password should contain a special character, in many cases, it should not start or end with a special character for usability and compatibility with various systems. 

9. Scenario: Check if the system can handle password generation interrupt.
   Description: Check what happens if the password generation process is interrupted - the system should either complete the password generation or cleanly stop the process without causing a crash or invalid state.
