"""
1. Verify the Label Creation: Validate that the function is able to instantiate a Label object without error. 

2. Verify the Label Attributes: Ensure that the Label object's attributes are correctly set. It should include details like parent window, associated text, font type, font size, background and foreground colors. 

3. Check Title Text: Verify that the text of the label reads 'Welcome to password generator' when accessed programmatically.

4. Check Font Settings: Validate that the Label's font settings are correctly set to 'Courrier, 20'. This can be checked by accessing the property programmatically after the instantiation.

5. Check Color Settings: Validate the color settings of the Label. It should have a gray background and black as the text color.

6. Validate Label Placement: Check if the label is being placed correctly into the window with the '.pack()' function.

7. Verify Exception Handling: Ensure the code handles exceptions properly, such as when the function doesn't have access to the parent window or if there are any issues with placing the label on the window.

8. Check Label Visibility: Although it's the UI test and doesn't directly pertain to the logic in the function, it would be good to ensure that the label is visible and rendered correctly when the application runs.

9. Verify Label doesn't Change: Run some application scenarios and ensure that the label text, color, and placement doesn't change after various operations of the password generator function, as it should remain constant in all conditions.

10. Check Non-interaction: As a label, the 'Welcome to password generator' text should not be interactive. This means it shouldn't be clickable and can't be focused.
