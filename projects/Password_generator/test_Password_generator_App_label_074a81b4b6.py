# Test generated by RoostGPT for test MiniPythonProjects using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

"""
1. Scenario: Validate if the "Welcome to password generator" label is correctly assigned.
    - Test if the title label is 'Welcome to password generator'
    - Check if an AssertError is returned when the title label is not 'Welcome to password generator'

2. Scenario: Check if syntax/grammar of the label text is correct.
    - Verify if the label text is spelled and capitalized correctly as per the requirement.

3. Scenario: Validate the font of the label.
    - Check if the font set is 'Courrier' and the size is 20 
    - Test whether a different font or size affects the application layout or not

4. Scenario: Check GUI attributes: bg (background color) and fg (foreground color). 
    - Test if the background color of the label is 'gray' 
    - Check whether the text color of the label is 'black'
    - Determine how the label appears when the bg/fg color deviates from the defined colors     

5. Scenario: Test GUI placement
    - Verify if the title label is properly packed/placed in the desired position on the GUI
    - Check how modifications in the placement of label impacts the appearance/functionality of the GUI

6. Scenario: Check label visibility
    - Confirm if the label is visible upon initializing the GUI
    - Check what happens when the label is hidden or disabled

7. Scenario: Validate the durability of the label
    - Check if upon refreshing or reallocating the GUI, the label remains consistent and does not change 
    - Validate if the label survives cases of re-drawing or re-setting the entire GUI

8. Scenario: Test the resizing of the window
    - Check if the label is resized or moved upon expanding or shrinking of the window.
    - Verify if the label remains visible and unaltered when the window is minimized
    - Verify if the font size remains consistent regardless of the window size 

9. Scenario: Validate consistency 
    - Check if label remains constant and doesn't change over time or with repeated uses
    - Ensure that repeated opening and closing of the window doesn't alter the label
