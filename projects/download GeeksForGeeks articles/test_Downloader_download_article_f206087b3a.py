"""
1. **Scenario: Valid URL Input**
    - Description: Test downloading an article given a valid URL. 
    - Expected Result: The function should open the URL in the browser, execute the print window script, and close the browser.

2. **Scenario: Invalid URL Input**
    - Description: Test downloading an article with an invalid URL input.
    - Expected Result: Proper error handling and messaging should be in place. An exception should be thrown, or the function should return some form of error code or message.

3. **Scenario: Response Time**
    - Description: Test to measure the response time of the downloader function.
    - Expected Result: This is more of a performance test. Your expected result will vary depending on the parameters set by your use case.

4. **Scenario: Downloading Article with Multiple Pages**
    - Description: Test downloading an article that spans multiple pages.
    - Expected Result: The function should be able to download all pages of the article.

5. **Scenario: URL Input Pointing to Non-article Page**
    - Description: Test the function with a URL that does not point to an article.
    - Expected Result: The function should appropriately handle this case. It might return an error or a specific response indicating the lack of an article.

6. **Scenario: Handling URL Shorteners**
    - Description: Test the function with a URL shortened by services like bit.ly or goo.gl.
    - Expected Result: The function should appropriately resolve the actual URL and proceed to download the article.

7. **Scenario: Navigating a CAPTCHA or Login Page**
    - Description: Test how the function handles URLs that lead to a page with a CAPTCHA or login requirement.
    - Expected Result: The function should appropriately handle these situations and not be able to bypass security measures that have been put in place.

8. **Scenario: Browser Support**
    - Description: Test whether function properly supports and works across different browsers.
    - Expected Result: The function should work properly across a variety of popular browsers (you can define which browsers in your actual test codes).
  
9. **Scenario: Network Failure during download**
    - Description: Test how the function handles network failures during download.
    - Expected Result: The function should be resilient, and not crash. Instead, should provide appropriate error handling and user feedback.
   
10. **Scenario: Article Availability Change during download**
    - Description: Test how the function handles cases where the article on the webpage changes or becomes unavailable during the download process.
    - Expected Result: The function should handle this gracefully with proper error handling techniques and feedbacks.

    # Test Scenario: Response Time
    # TODO: Requires an implementation of time-based assertion considering your use case

    # Test Scenario: Downloading Article with Multiple Pages
    # TODO: Requires an implementation emulating the behavior of a multipage article

    # Test Scenario : URL Input Pointing to Non-article Page
    # We're unable to distinguish between a webpage and an article page via browser 
    # As such we'll assume any URL is valid if it evokes no error in the execution

    # Test Scenario: Handling URL Shorteners
    # Since this function only interacts with the browser, it naturally supports url resolution 
    # provided the browser used by selenium can handle it. 

    # Test Scenario: Navigating a Captcha or Login Page
    # This is typically beyond the scope of this function if solving captcha or logging in 
    # before download is within tasks for users. 

    # Test Scenario: Browser Support
    # This test should cover testing if other browser drivers can run the same code. 
    # This is usually handled when you configure the selenium setup function

    # Test Scenario: Network Failure

    # Test Scenario: Article Availability Change during Download
    # This isn't testable using a unit test, as we cannot simulate the situation
    # where the article changes in between a single download operation.
